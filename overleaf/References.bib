From the initial cryptocurrency to the current smart contract, blockchain has been applied to many fields. Although there are some studies on the security and privacy issues of blockchain, there lacks a systematic examination on the security of blockchain systems. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the security threats to blockchain and survey the corresponding real attacks by examining popular blockchain systems. We also review the security enhancement solutions for blockchain, which could be used in the development of various blockchain systems, and suggest some future directions to stir research efforts into this area.}

    edition = {2nd},
    abstract = {Cryptography is ubiquitous and plays a key role in ensuring data secrecy and integrity as well as in securing computer systems more broadly. Introduction to Modern Cryptography provides a rigorous yet accessible treatment of this fascinating subject. The authors introduce the core principles of modern cryptography, with an emphasis on formal definitions, clear assumptions, and rigorous proofs of security. The book begins by focusing on private-key cryptography, including an extensive treatment of private-key encryption, message authentication codes, and hash functions. The authors also present design principles for widely used stream ciphers and block ciphers including RC4, DES, and AES, plus provide provable constructions of stream ciphers and block ciphers from lower-level primitives. The second half of the book covers public-key cryptography, beginning with a self-contained introduction to the number theory needed to understand the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and El Gamal cryptosystems (and others), followed by a thorough treatment of several standardized public-key encryption and digital signature schemes. Integrating a more practical perspective without sacrificing rigor, this widely anticipated Second Edition offers improved treatment of: Stream ciphers and block ciphers, including modes of operation and design principles Authenticated encryption and secure communication sessions Hash functions, including hash-function applications and design principles Attacks on poorly implemented cryptography, including attacks on chained-CBC encryption, padding-oracle attacks, and timing attacks The random-oracle model and its application to several standardized, widely used public-key encryption and signature schemes Elliptic-curve cryptography and associated standards such as DSA/ECDSA and DHIES/ECIES Containing updated exercises and worked examples, Introduction to Modern Cryptography, Second Edition can serve as a textbook for undergraduate- or graduate-level courses in cryptography, a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners, or a general introduction suitable for self-study.}

    abstract = {We introduce a new cryptographic primitive, called proxy re-encryption with keyword search, which is motivated by the following scenario in email systems: Charlie sends an encrypted email, which contains some keywords, such as “urgent”, to Alice under Alice’s public key, and Alice delegates her decryption rights to Bob via her mail server. The desired situations are: (1) Bob can decrypt mails delegated from Alice by using only his private key, (2) Bob’s mail gateway, with a trapdoor from Bob, can test whether the email delegated from Alice contains some keywords, such as “urgent”, (3) Alice and Bob do not wish to give the mail server or mail gateway the access to the content of emails. The function of proxy re-encryption with keyword search (PRES) is the combination of proxy re-encryption (PRE) and public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS). However, a PRES scheme cannot be obtained by directly combining those two schemes, since the resulting scheme is no longer proven secure in our security model. In this paper, a concrete construction is proposed, which is proven secure in the random oracle model, based on the modified Decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption.}

Despite the emergence of large-scale testbeds for network research, simulation still plays a vital role in terms of scalability (both in size and in experimental speed), reproducibility, rapid prototyping, and education. With simulation based studies, the approach can be studied in detail at varying scales, with varying data applications, varying field conditions, and will result in reproducible and analyzable results.},
